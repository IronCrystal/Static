TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. DEFINITIONS
"You" are the individual or single entity making use of the project.
"This License" refers to version 1 of the Secure Protected License.
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
"The Project" refers to the project in it's whole, including but not limited to the source code of the project, associated graphics, sounds or music. 
// what is the difference between licensee and licensor??
    "Licensees", "Recipients" and "Licensors" may be individuals or organisations.
    "Licensees" may be referred to as "you", "the user", "the editor".
    The "Licensor" is the individual/team that holds the copyright to the project.
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an "exact copy". The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. Another work that is an exact copy of the project shall be referenced to as an "alternate build" or "alternat package"
A "covered work" means either an alternate build or a modified version.
To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
The “Appropriate Legal Notices” shall be displayed to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that (licensees) may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list 
meets this criterion.
